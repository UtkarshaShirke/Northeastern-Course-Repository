Project Description: 

The goal of this project is to create a database containing all relevant resources. The resources database will include: 

Programs offered on the Boston campus of Northeastern University in the College of Engineering, and details about their duration, offerings, and specializations. 
The relevant study material (paid and free resources) for all courses offered by COE. 
Tools and software required by the courses.  
Program contacts (Professors/Advisors/Current Teaching Assistants). 
Future career outcomes post-degree completion. 

We aspire to help learners through our initiative by helping them collate the resources they need to navigate their course. 

Questions that the database should answer: 

1.What are the paid resources and their pricing? 
2.What courses are sponsored by NEU or offered at a discounted price? 
3.What are the best-rated online end-to-end courses (that provide a completion certificate) available? (Coursera, Edx, Udemy, Harvard, Linked Learning, Stanford, MIT, etc)
4.What are the professional certifications I can acquire for my program? (PMP, CAPM, Oracle Developer, Azure, AWS, SQL developer, etc.)
5.What are the research papers available for the course? 
6.Which software do we need to install as a prerequisite for the course?
7.Which different tools/IDEs are available and compatible to use for the course?
8.Where can I find the youtube videos for installing the aforementioned software/IDEs? 
9.Which are the official websites to download them/documentation?
10.Which are the free practice platforms to strengthen my learning? 


Strategy:

We are planning to web scrape the NEU’s website and other educational platforms extensively to gather data. 
We would research and conduct surveys to collate the best fit for our database. 
We would be then using the above information to create the resources database for any particular course offerings. 

Outcome:

A consolidated resource repository as a database that is publicly available on GitHub. This will include documentation on how to use the database and a detailed walkthrough by the end of the project. 

Note: For the scope of this project we are picking only 3 Masters’ programs from COE and we’ll build our database around these programs. The questions attached below are modeled around the following courses: 
1.Masters of Science in Information Systems
2.Masters of Science in Data Analytics Engineering
3.Masters of Science Software Engineering Systems
